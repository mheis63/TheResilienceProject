I've never written the whole story down. I can still remember the day it all started, in September 1999. Of course, it truly started with the headaches but that was the day the source was found. I donâ€™t actually remember being aware of what was happening. One second I was being dropped off at school after a weird doctor appointment, and the next I was being picked up again and told we were driving to St Louis. And then it felt like it was over in a week, of course I know now that my recovery was a bit longer. But as a six year old, I was so unaware of what was happening around me. The only thing I did know was that I was going to get sick again. 

I never shared that with anyone. But for all of second grade I sat with the weird feeling that I was going to have to do it all again. I was getting MRIs every three months to make sure I didn't have any tumor growth after the initial resection. At almost a two years after the first operation, a spot was seen at the top of my spine. It's unusual for a JPA brain tumor to grow back after resection (only 3% do). Its also unusual for a JPA to spread (only 2%). Mine did both. I began chemotherapy soon after and I don't recall at all how the decision was made to do it. What I do remember vividly was the conversation my parents had where they told me it had come back.

The next 18 years were spent dealing with various health issues as they arose. I spent a year paralyzed and getting radiation when a spot on my spine grew rapidly. I learned how to walk again but came away with scoliosis and an even worse gait. In high school spots in my brain were growing and we had run out of traditional treatment options. I began going to Laurie Children's in Chicago and going through every clinical trial my dad and doctor found till we found one that ended up helping me eventually reach remission. 

Its now been over 10 years since I've been on treatment of some sort.
